    "Blink" : "<h3><b>Blink (Deity of Space, Traveler):</b></h3> <p>Blink is one of the original deities, no one knows what gender they are. They are found as both male and female in the wild. Blink is involved in the majority of the world, they rarely interfere with humanoid affairs, unless it is necessary. Blink can appear wherever they choose by tearing a hole into space and connecting the rifts. However, to onlookers, it appears that they just blink into existence, hence their name. It is also said that they have some time powers, but the powers are not as strong as Timey. Blink can also see the past and future, and see how anyone is feeling and thinking. Blink, Timey, and Falion are called the triple deity due to their time powers and family relations. Blink and Timey created infinite space and time. Without them, nothing would exist.</p>",
    "Timey" : "<h3><b>Timey (God of Time):</b></h3> <p>Timey is one of the original deities. Timey made time itself, without him everything wouldn’t exist. Not much is known about Timey, just that he and Blink are lovers. They had a few children, only Falion is of note. It is said that Timey has been in a coma since the creation of the world. He went into this state to have a continuous time, where the past, present, and future are separated. If Timey was to wake up, time will fall out of sync, causing a dimension-wide apocalypse. There are ways to talk to him in this state, but it requires a great deal of magic and or connection to Timey. Most deities leave him alone for the universe's good.</p>",
    "Zanthith" : "<h3><b>Zanthith (God of War and Binding, Creator, Deceased):</b></h3> <p>Zanthith is one of the original deities. Zanthith has gone by many names, the main 2 are Zanthith and Maxwell. Zanthith decided to live down with the people instead of in Exanina. This leads to him to see the deities in a different light, seeing them for what they do to the people. He also seen how the people treated each other. Zanthith isn’t only the God of war but he is also the god of Binding. His whole life he has bound the magic to people and items. He would usually not choose a side in any war, he would either withhold from the war entirely or help both sides till they were on equal playing fields. Zanthith is known for constructing the Yato, the blade to kill the gods. He gave his life to construct this relic. May, his descendant, is the new goddess of war and binding.</p>",
    "Hunmie" : "<h3><b>Hunmie (Deity of Nature, Creator):</b></h3> <p>Hunmie is one of the original deities. Like Zanthith, Hunmie goes by many names, Hunmie and Rose are the main ones used. Hunmie is known for her control of nature, they can control life itself; however, they mainly control plant life. Hunmie, The Enchantress, Saildor, and Zanthith are known as the parents of life. Together they created all that we know. Hunmie will do anything to protect her lover The Enchantress. It is said that she refused to help any of the other deities create the universe if The Enchantress wasn’t a part of it. Hunmie is the mother of the universe, she takes care of all her creations. She sometimes favoring her creations over her children. If she doesn’t like you, you are going to have a rough life. (If they even let you live).</p>",
    "The Enchantress" : "<h3><b>The Enchantress (The Immortal Entity, Creator, Avenger):</b></h3> <p>While The Enchantress isn’t a goddess, she is a very powerful Enchantress. She goes by many names, The Enchantress and Alice are her main ones. She used to be viewed as the Goddess of Magic before Kasie took that title from her. The Enchantress is an odd case, she can’t die from aging. She is also very hard to kill in general. Some people think it is because Hunmie refuses to let her die. But it appears that she doesn’t rely on Hunmie to keep her alive. Her magic is different from the magic we use. Some people think the raw magic she uses is what keeps her alive. While The Enchantress is very powerful, it appears that none of the marbles choose her to be their champion. The deities are afraid of her though, while the deities can only be killed by the Yato or another deity, somehow The Enchantress has killed a god. Maybe from her strange magic, but no one knows.</p>",
    "Saildor" : "<h3><b>Saildor (Goddess of Earth, Architect, Head Deity, Creator):</b></h3> <p>Saildor is one of the original deities. Together Saildor, Hunmie, The Enchantress, and Zanthith created the worlds and life itself. Saildor also goes by many names, including The Creator, Saildor, the Architect, and Sahra. Saildor is a different type of deity, she has no hands. They were taken away so she could create the universe. She created a new pair of hands for herself. Whatever she imagines comes into existence. This allowed her to create planets and structures. She uses her power to try and keep the deities in order. She is seen as their leader, even though she isn’t the most powerful one of them. She also designed most of the holy places and Exanina, the home of the gods. Exanina is where the majority of the deities live, it also holds the afterlife for living beings; However, the afterlife sections are called Danina.</p>",
    "Slicer" : "<h3><b>Slicer (God of Fire):</b></h3> <p>Slicer is one of the original deities. He used to be a being called a Planeswalker, though not much is known of Planeswalkers. Slicer only came with the group to save his own life. The group let him come because they needed his power to come (or whatever that means). However, Slicer doesn’t particularly like most of the originals. He seems to have two main personalities. One is of general hatred of the deities, and the other is trying to keep him from killing them all. Though he is homicidal at times, he is still considered a “good” god. He gave fire to the people and helped them with many of their requests. It is said that he tries to help the world stay stable, killing those who threaten existence itself. His main motivation is himself and to kill Sheins. Still have no clue what a Shein is, but maybe they are dangerous or something?</p>",
    "Gaymon" : "<h3><b>Gaymon (God of Love, Oldest):</b></h3> <p>Gaymon is the first child born from the deities, as a child, he was loved and taken care of by his parents. When his Zanxa, his younger sister, was born he wouldn’t let her out of his sight. He would take care of her when their parents were busy. When he turned 16 it was time for his ascension day. Everyone gathered at The Gathering Grounds, all of the deities came for this event. Zanxa was worried, she thought that when he ascended he wouldn’t have time for her anymore. But Gaymon reassured her that he would always have time for his little sister. He promised that when she ascended he would show her the ropes of divinity. When he went to the table the marbles were still. Then a deep red marble glowed, as if it chose Gaymon. It flung into his chest, tearing him apart, atom by atom. Then it restitched him together, as the marble becoming one with him. He felt a rush of power, that was when he knew, he was now divine. The deities rejoiced and had a party for 5 days in the First World. After the party, Gaymon found out what his power was, the power of love. Wherever he went, people would fall in love with him. Gaymon turned them all down though, he wanted to wait for “the one” to come to him.</p> <p>Then it came to his sister’s ascension day. He held her hand, and told her she had nothing to fear. That she would become a fierce goddess and show the world what she can do. However, when Zanxa went up to the Altar none of the marbles glowed. She sat there for an hour before Slicer interrupted, he called her broken, a disgrace, a Null. He left with his daughter and soon all the others left. Till just Gaymon and The Enchantress remained. Gaymon stayed all night with her by the Altar, she bawled her eyes out. The Enchantress showed sympathy towards her daughter. She told her she wasn’t broken, she is just the way she is meant to be. She offered to teach her powerful magic. Throughout the night the three sat together. A few years later Slicer's daughter was deemed a “Null”. Gaymon noticed how she felt. So He and Zanxa stayed with her, while she cried, being abandoned from her dad. A few months later Gaymon found out Zanxa had a crush on Candie, Slicer's 'null'. So he decided to help them with their relationship. He set them up on a few dates. He and The Enchantress was the only of the deities who attended their wedding. He blessed his sister’s wedding and her wife to have the most joyful life together. He then began to start blessing plenty of weddings and divorces, thus becoming known as the God of Love.</p>",
    "Valley" : "<h3><b>Valley (Goddess of Animals, Protector):</b></h3> <p>Valley is the youngest of Humnie’s and The Enchantress’ kids. She is the 6th child in her family. With most of her siblings being deemed Nulls, no one expected Valley to become divine. Only her family came to the ascension, since everyone believed she wasn’t special. But when it came time for her to go to the Altar, one of the marbles glowed and flung into her, fusing with her body. Everyone was surprised, even Gaymon. When she merged, Hunmie went straight to the deities and told them about her child. However, since First World was destroyed, they couldn’t party like tradition. So instead they partied in Glansward, the main palace in Exanina. Valley partied like there was no tomorrow. She was one of the drunkest of the deities there. This led them to believe that she was the goddess of parties and alcohol. But some just thought she was drinking to forget Slicer’s invitation to be his wife.</p><p>Slicer was very, very adamant about her being his bride. He adored the way she could handle her liquor. He loved her fierceness, that she didn’t need a man. But the man also included Slicer, which made him impatient with her. When she would tell him to back off, he would only get more aggravated with her. One time when she told him no, he followed her back to her house on Exanina. She said to back off and leave her alone, but he wasn’t having it. Valley went to her mother for protection and guidance. The Enchantress let her in and told her to let mommy take care of him. The Enchantress shut her door and went to talk to Slicer. She told him to stay away from her child, or there will be great consequences. He said that he will do what he wants, and will not have a Null order him around. The Enchantress was taking none of this bs, she cast a spell to transport her house to a different planet, so he couldn’t find Valley. Slicer was angry and tried to burn The Enchantress, but she laughed and redirected his flames. She then summoned a sword and spoke an ancient spell into it, then struck Slicer. He became paralyzed, and she cut off his dick, so tha he couldn’t force it onto anyone anymore. Then she called upon Blink to make him go away. Blink warped him away from Exanina, and then The Enchantress exploded his tiny dick. And went to find Valley.</p><p>Valley appeared in a forest on planet 102. She didn’t know how to teleport or anything so she went through the forest and tried to find help. After a few hours, she smelled fire, a forest fire. She knew it was Slicer, she started panicking and ran the opposite way. Then an eagle came to her, this was no ordinary eagle. The eagle was the Destination Eagle, one of Blink's creations, it has the power to take anyone to where they need to be. Valley saw the eagle fly to her, not knowing it was anything special, she ran and panicked even more. Till the Eagle spoke to her, “Fear not Valley, I am here to help.” After it spoke so did all the other animals. It appears that she can talk to animals. The animals created a distraction, to make Slicer not be able to search for Valley. The D-Eagle brought her to Saildor, who created a restraint order for Slicer. He would be killed on the spot if he was ever within 3 miles of her ever again.</p>",
    "Forsway" : "<h3><b>Forsway (Goddess of Wind):</b></h3> <p>Slicer wasn’t the type to settle down, he would usually pay people to sleep with him. A young girl named Clair was one of these girls. But Slicer has given up on the paying bit, too many Nulls being born. He would choose a girl he thought would give birth to a divine and then threaten to kill everything they loved. He kidnapped Clair from her family, told her if she didn’t have his children, he would kill everyone in her village. After he put he impregnated in her, he burned her house down. He made sure the family wasn’t in the house, so he would still have leverage. He wanted to show her he would kill them if she crossed him. After she gave birth to her baby girl, Slicer slit her throat. He couldn’t have anyone else’s voice in his kid's head, he didn't want another Candie situation happening. He raised his new child in seclusion. She was put in a tower on planet 65, she lived on her own. Slicer would visit every once in a while. Just enough to make sure she wouldn’t forget him. When it came to ascension day, he brought her to the Altar. Everyone was confused, they had no clue this girl existed. But when the marble fused with her they knew she was divine. Slicer decided she was important enough for a name. So he named her Trash.</p><p>Trash moved in with Slicer, she learned her powers, the power of the wind. She could do so much that she never thought was possible. One day, a knock was heard on the door. Trash was alone, Slicer went to an Deity meeting. So she opened the door, and to her surprise it was Valley. Valley asked her if she was ok. Trash said yes and invited her in. They got to talking, and Valley noticed how Trash kept treated herself and how brainwashed she was. Valley offered her a girl's night out on Planet 102. Trash said yes, but as long as she was back before Slicer came home. She didn’t want him to get mad at her for leaving without permission. So they head off to Planet 102. Valley showed Trash around and introduced her to some of the animals. The animals saw how she treated herself and gave her a new more fitting name, Forsway the goddess of the wind. After a while, Forsway realized the time, so she bagged Valley to take her home. The two went back to Slicer's place. Valley gave her a ticket and told her when she was ready to leave Slicer, tear up the ticket.</p><p>Forsway knocked on the door to see if Slicer was home. To her surprise, he was. He was angry at her for being late and leaving without permission. He grabbed her by the hair and tossed her onto the couch. He took off his belt and started whipping her. She screamed, but no one heard. She then decided to fight back for the first time in her life, for her talk with Valley inspired her. She pushed Slicer down and stood up. She said, 'Enough, I am a powerful Goddess, I don't need someone like you in my life”. This made him mad, he struck at her with a fiery whip. It burned into her skin. He tried to strike again, but he stopped. He was paralyzed. As if his own body was trying to stop him. Forsway ripped the ticket, and she was then transported to The Enchantress. The Enchantress saw her pain and got to work healing her. However, the burn was too deep, so a scar formed over her left cheek. The Enchantress then took her to Hunmie to watch her. As The Enchantress does something that will excommunicate her for the rest of her life. No one knows what happened that day. All they know is after she came home. Slicer was dead, or so everyone thought.</p>",
    "Galsmore" : "<h3><b>Galsmore (God of Decaying, God of Danina):</b></h3> <p>After a week from Slicer’s death. From the decaying corpse came a bird of fire, a Phoenix. As the Phoenix landed on the ground, it formed a girl, her name was Ignius. But most of the people call her Slicer. This Slicer seems to act differently and is a whole new person compared to the old Slicer. The Phenix Slicer looked at its decayed corpse, with pity if forced its magic into it. The corpse flew into the air as ash and decaying bits of the god. As these ashes flew they fell into a river and the water formed it into a shape, a baby. On a walk, one of Valley saw the baby and brought it to her girlfriend and asked her what they should do. Saildor decided that Valley and her should raise it together. So they did. Valley asked Saildor what they should name him, and Saildor said Galsmore seems like a fitting name. </p><p>The baby grew up in their mansion, he had a good life. When some of the deities asked about the baby, they were told that the baby was adopted. Most of the deities accepted Galsmore into the deity family. Some were hesitant since it had no divine blood in it. But Valley and Saildor loved Galsomore with their whole heart, no matter what anyone said. However, when it came to Galsmore’s 16th birthday, they didn’t know if they should do an ascension ceremony. But, Valley insisted to do it, so Salidor gave in. They gathered all the deities as Galsmore was anxiously waiting. Saildor told Galsmore that there is a chance that none of the marbles will choose him, being that he was adopted, but they will love him no matter what happens. Galsmore walked up to the Altar, but before he got there a marble shot into him. This is the first time a marble was attached before the kid reached the Altar. It was remarkable, but it made the deities wonder if anyone could become fused to the marbles. During the party, Galsmore was welcomed into the family by everyone. When Slicer came to welcome Galsmore, Slicer was hesitant. Galsmore asked him what was wrong, but Slicer couldn’t put his mind to it. It was like he knew Galsmore more than he knew himself. Slicer refused to shake his hand though, he felt that something bad might happen. So they just went back to the party.</p><p>After the party when they returned home, Valley wanted to figure out her son’s powers. When Galsmore picked up a carrot, a gray light came from his hands. The carrot started to rot and decay. This is when they found out that Galsmore had the power to decay. A few years later Galsmore decided to visit his grandparents. He came when The Enchantress was during a strong ritual. When Galsmore interrupted the ritual everything went haywire. She tried to protect him, but before she could, Galsmore decayed the magic. When using his powers she saw deep within him. She knew he used to be Slicer. She summoned a sword and pointed it at Galsmore. Galsmore, understandably confused, asked what was going on. She said, “Nice, try Slicer, hiding and pretending to be my grandson to kill me. But it will not work, I will make sure to vanquish you for good this time.”  Galsmore said that he wasn’t Slicer, and started to panic as his grandmother started casting a spell. He quickly decayed her spell before she could cast it. Watching him do this she realized that Galsmore wasn’t exactly Slicer. They talked and Galsmore wanted to know why he was like this. So he asked Blink to look into his past to find out what is going on. Blink looked into his past, and saw his rebirth. And told them both this. They were both startled by the information and didn’t know what to do. So Blink gave them some wisdom, “Even though you have the body of a horrible person. It doesn’t make you Slicer, you are still Galsmore. You get the choice of who you want to be.” Galsmore took this message to heart and decided that he was going to do the opposite of what Slicer did. </p><p>He went to Salidor and asked her if he could run Danina, the underworld. He wanted to help people move on into a better place. He wanted to help people heal from their past and help them move on. So Salidor gave him control of Danina. She told him to take care of the dead and show them the respect they deserve. He then became the God of Daninan.</p>",
    "Vale" : "<h3><b>Vale (God of Water, Water Weaver):</b></h3> <p>Vale is Saildor and Valley’s second kid, but their first biological kid. After Galsmore’s ascension, Saildor and Valley decided to have another kid. When the baby was born Saildor chose to name it after her true love, Valley. Vale grew up in the mansion with Galsmore, they went on many adventures together. One of Vale’s fondest memories was when they went to Planet 102 without their moms’ permission. They both snuck out when their parents were at meeting. Galsmore brought his brother through the portal door. They ventured into the forest and found a town. While walking the forest edge a child fell into the harsh river. The kid's parents were nowhere to be seen. Galsmore tried to decay the flow of the river, but it wasn’t working. The current was too strong, so Vale jumped into the river. He swam over to the child and grabbed him. He forced his way through the current and imagined the water helping him get out. Vale managed to make it out with the kid. Galsmore found the parents and brought them to the river. They hugged their child and thanked the boys for their help. They offered to feed them for saving their kid, but Galsmore declined. He said they needed to get back home. On the boy's way back to the portal, they saw Saildor was waiting by the door. She was upset that they left without permission. She was terrified they might have been hurt. But when hearing what Vale did, she was super proud him for saving the kid. Saildor gave Vale the nickname of Water Weaver. </p><p>When it came to Vale’s ascension day, it was no surprise that the water marble chose him. When the marble merged with Vale, it is said all over the universe the water stopped moving for a few seconds. After the merge was complete, the water began to flow again. The moisture in the air in the gathering grounds started swirling and created powerful rain in the room. Galsmore was the first to congratulate Vale, he gave his brother a big hug. Then the party began, and everyone had a great time.</p><p>One day, a big riot was happening on planet 115, Saildor wanted to test Vale’s powers and peacemaking skills. Saildor sent Vale to planet 115, but she came with him to make sure nothing gets out of hand. When they arrived they saw the two forces, a bunch of townspeople versus a group of people claiming to have a god on their side. Vale decided to go and try and find out who was causing this chaos. He changed his form in the water, to look like one of the Gaur, the people with a god. He then infiltrated their camp, found one of the Gaurines, and asked what was going on. The Gaurine explained that the Faune took their land, and they were going to take it back with the help of their god. Vale asked to see their 'god', and the Gaurine brought him to his tent. Vale knocked on the tent, and a woman came out. She asked, 'Who are you, I know all of my followers, and you are not one of them.' Vale exclaimed, 'I am a new follower, what abilities do you possess?' She scoffed, saying you are not a follower, my followers know what power I have. Vale, knowing she wasn’t a deity pulled the moisture in the air into a ball of water. 'I am Vale, god of water. Who are you to claim to be a god?' He asked. She jumps back at his power and responds. 'I am Naybp, god of fire. Child of Slicer, god of fire.' She creates a fireball above her head. 'If you don’t leave my camp, there will be a problem here.' Vale not taking her crap called shot his water ball at her fire. As the water collides with her fire, it splashes her. She got upset and lit her tent on fire, with Vale inside it. Vale seeing that he was in a burning-down tent panicked. He created water around the tent, being the first time Vale has done this though, it didn’t go as planned. He ended up summoning way too much water, creating a planet-wide flood. Sailidor sees the flood coming and started to worry. She created a dam around the village to keep them safe. She then rushed over to the center of the flood, tents were destroyed, horses and people drowning, and people were dead from the impact. Vale surfaced from the water, he gasped for air (Note: Vale can breathe underwater, but it takes a few seconds for this power to activate). Saildor lifted the earth under him for him to stand on. From that day onwards, Saildor decided not to take Vale on missions again.</p>",
    "Nomanie" : "<h3><b>Nomanie (Goddess of Weather):</b></h3> <p>Forsway met Vale at his party, and from then on she developed a crush on him. One day when they were both drunk, Forsway brought Vale back to her house. They had a 'fun' night together, but in the morning Vale left. Forsway still was in love with Vale, however before she got the chance to ask him to marry her, some human beat her to it. She attended Vale’s wedding and secretly wished the human was her. But after time passed, she lost feelings for Vale. Then one day she went into labor, and she completely forgot the hookup with Vale. She was surprised by the pregnancy, she didn’t know she was pregnant. When the baby was born, it was a baby girl. Forsway decided to name her daughter Nomanie, for she didn’t need a man to help raise her. Forsway, knowing she was going to be better than her dad, decided to spoil her child and give her all the freedom she could want.</p><p>Nomanie spent most of her time growing up on planet 122, Forsway wanted her to experience the life of a mortal. Whenever Nomanie wanted something, like new clothing, she would beg Forsway for it. Forsway would always give Nomanie whatever she asked for. This lead to Nomanie getting whatever she wants, right when she wants it, or she would scream. When it came to Nomanie’s ascension day, all the deities gathered. No one knew who was Nomanie’s father, they just knew she had divine blood. When she went to the Altar she demanded it to give her a marble. The Altar not taking any of her crap, threw a marble at her forehead so hard that she flew across the room. All the deities watched this Karen moment happen. Some even laughed at her being yeeted. Some thanked the Altar for throwing her. However, as she hit the ground the marble fused with her. She was so furious that she was thrown that a huge thunderstorm broke out in the gathering grounds. Destroying and damaging lots of priceless artifacts. Forsway took Nomanie out of the gathering grounds and apologized. Nomanie’s ascension was the first to not be celebrated by a party. Saildor was left to fix many of the artifacts and houses damaged.</p><p>When Nomanie was taken back to planet 122, Forsway was upset. She asked her daughter why she did that. Nomanie got angry at Forsway for not taking her side. She yelled at her mom saying she was entitled to get a marble, and that Altar was the one at fault for throwing her. Forsway left and didn’t talk to her daughter for years after this interaction. She was ashamed that her daughter turned out like this. Nomanie, angry at this, decided that she was the superior deity and created multiple cults in her name. She also went planet to planet making them give her gifts and worship her, or else she would destroy all of their homes.</p>",
    "Mailar" : "<h3><b>Mailar (God of Darkness, Shadow Controller):</b></h3> <p>One day after guiding a spirit to Danina, Galsmore felt very sick. He ran to his mothers and asked if they could help him. Salidor went over to Mailar with some of her powers. She saw there was something strange inside him, she had The Enchantress take a closer look. The Enchantress announced that Galsmore was pregnant and was about to go into labor. This was strange since Galsmore didn’t have a lover or anyone he hooked up with. The Enchantress prepped Galsmore for surgery and called some of the best doctors to help. After 3 hours of surgery, a baby emerged. Galsmore decided on the name Kaison, after the doctor who stayed for the whole 3 hours. Galsmore took Kaison back to Danina. </p><p>The child was like any other it cried when needed something and it was very dependent on his dad. He grew up helping his dad move people to Danina from death. But something was wrong, Kaison didn't just do it to help the spirits, he would stay and watch the person die, long before he was sent to bring them over. He particularly liked to watch them suffer, he would watch them cry out in pain this would bring Kaison pleasure. There are also some tales of him causing suffering. He would go to dying people and torture them till they begged him to stop, but he never did. Galsmore never found out about this in Kaison’s childhood. When it came to Kaison’s ascension day everyone gathered. Kaison went up to the Altar, and a cold breeze was felt in the gathering grounds. Most of them knew something was wrong. Blink tried to stop the marble from merging with Kaison, but it was too late. All of the lights in the room went out. A laugh was heard. Salidor tried to create light, but the darkness ate it up, like it was a cheese ball to a mouse. Most of the deities ran, till it was just Galsmore and his son. Galsmore asked why Kaison was doing this. Kaison responded, “I know more than you could ever know Galsmore, you are so naive to think that this would end up like everyone else's ascension.” The darkness vanished and so did Kaison. </p><p>Galsmore ran through Exanina looking for Kaison, but all he found was that Zane’s mask was missing. Galsmore panicked, he ran to Saildor and told her what had happened with the mask. They arranged an emergency deity meeting to discuss what is to happen next. They decided to arrange a search party to find the mask. But the main problem was that the mask has disabling deity powers, so they couldn’t track it. They went planet to planet but couldn’t find it, such a small item in a galaxy was to hard to find. Even The Enchantress couldn’t find it, but she had an idea, she was going to summon Kaison and make him talk. Everyone gathered and put their power into the spell. It was so strong that the ground started to break and turn to dust. Then appeared in front of everyone was Kaison. He spoke, “I am no longer Kaison, I am Mailar God of Darkness. If you call upon me again, it will be your last.” Galsmore asked him where the mask was. “Zane and I got to talking, and we think it is best if we break apart from you people. We are going to rule the universe together. I will find a way to break him free, then all of you will regret ever putting him in that prison. You will never find us again, till it's too late.” Then he vanished. Now if you were to say his name, darkness will come, he will come. Don’t do it. I beg of you, only bad things will come.</p>",
    "Falion" : "<h3><b>Falion (Goddess of Time, The All-Seer):</b></h3> <p>Blink is in love with Timey, no one knows how, but they had a baby with him. This baby is named Falion. Falion grew up with Blink, she traveled the universe with her mom. Not much is known about Falion, but when it came to her ascension day Falion didn’t go to the gathering grounds. The main reason is all the marble was taken already. So there was no ascension able to happen. However, most people believe Falion is still a goddess. Since her dad is in a coma, Falion is the only one who is in control of time. It is said, what ever Falion says, will come to reality. People say that they see Falion on the streets, asking for gold to give people their futures. After Falion reads their future, she vanishes leaving a statue of herself where she stood. Thousands of these statues are all over the place. She usually doesn’t appear in the same town twice, for she doesn’t like to be recognized as a goddess.</p> <p>Falion was the only one of the old gods to have made it past The Calamity. It is said that she created the plan to reset the timeline again, foreseeing all the events, and stringing everyone along. Some say they see her around, guiding young adventures to make a living. Who knows what her plan is?</p>",
    "Kasie" : "<h3><b>Kasie (Deity of Magic, Mafia Boss, Blink):</b></h3> <p>Kasie comes from a different world. They were from a head of a mafia family in their home world. They have spiky long red hair and red eyes. In their time on their homeworld, they were traumatized by their “family” backstabbing them when they arrived home. They later found out most of their family was killed, and replaced by shapeshifters. Just before Kasie and their group went to kill a “evil” necromancer, Blink brought them into a new world. While traveling time and space, a bond around them wouldn't allow them to travel. When Blink broke the bond it changed Kasie, their DNA and body shifted, from a male to a female. Blink after seeing all that traumatized them, decided to take them in. Blink became a motherly figure to Kasie. Kasie asked Blink to change them back into a guy, but Blink wasn’t able to. So Blink brought them to The Enchantress, she tried to change them back; however, what ever the bond was, it was impossible to be undone. </p><p>On Kasie’s 21st birthday, Blink gave them a full tour around Exanina. Blink decided they were ready to see some of the most sacred places in her homeland. She brought them to the gathering grounds and showed them the Altar. The Altar held one last marble, the marble of magic. Kasie went to look at the marble, when suddenly it started to glow. It chose them to be its champion. The marble merged with them, making the two become one. Blink was surprised the marble chose them, for all the marble merged with their champions at age 16. Not only that, but the magic marble refused to choose anyone for centuries. It was as if the marble was waiting for Kasie to have it. Blink organized the deities together and they had a party. Kasie was quickly welcomed into the big family of deities. Kasie was truly happy, after all that happened to them. Kasie finally had a family who loved them for them, not because they were the mafia boss, but because Kasie was Kasie.</p><p>When Kasie went home from the party, they spent all night trying to fix their gender. But nothing worked, even with all magic in the universe at their will, it couldn’t fix them. They cut their hair and started using a binder. Blink supported Kasie with all that they did. Blink went on a journey to try to find out a way to help their child. But Blink couldn’t find anything, this power was stronger than anything Blink could do or seek. Kasie decided to try and redefine magic itself, they created a new connection to magic, a stronger connection. This connection allowed people to be more diverse with magic. They created thousands of different spells and spread them widely. Making common people able to learn magic. Kasie decided to rule over planet 169, with the help of some of their friends. Kasie, May (Goddess of War and Binding), Vale (God of Water), and Valley (Goddess of Animals) all came together to rule planet 169. Just because Kasie cares about people, doesn’t mean they will not hesitate to smite people who deserve it.</p>",
    "May" : "<h3><b>May (Goddess of War and Binding, Youngest):</b></h3> <p>May grew up in a normal family, she was very smart and intelligent. She knew that one day, she would be something more than a farm hand. One day, a group of ragtag adventurers approached her and said, “Kid do you want to be a god”. May followed the adventures to their bar’s backroom. There lay a dying old man, she was told that she was a descendant of a god. That she had to take his powers to stop the universe from going into countless wars. May accepted her duties and was fused with the marble. She then ascended into the heavens and became one with the deities. Though May was 13 when she ascended, the youngest anyone has ascended, she was welcomed into the family. When the deities learned that Zanthith was dead after the party, they held a funeral to put him to rest. When pushed on how Zanthith died, May refused to tell them. </p><p>May is the last of the deities to ascend. Not much is known about her since she ascended so recently, all we know is that she took over quickly to all of Zanthith’s duties. It was so quick, people started wondering how she knew how to use the marble so easily. May just told them that she was smart, that she knew what the marble did from her studies, and from her family history.</p> <p>However, the people should have questioned her more. May is believed to be the one who caused The Calamity. She revealed herself as the demon who powered the marble of binding, she wanted to free her siblings from within each marble. The only way she knew they would be safe was if she used all of them to travel back in time to restart the timeline again. May was said to be destroyed when the timeline was reset again.</p>",
    "Hope" : "<h3><b>Hope (Being of Magic, Swordling)</b></h3> <p>Hope is one of the many children of The Enchantress. However, she is the only one to not be born to Hunmie. Hope was born in a timeline called the Anti-Verse, this timeline is a parallel universe that is connected to the real timeline. Anything that happened to people in the Anti-Verse happened to those people in the real timeline. Hope was born on the remains of First World in the Anti-Verse. This planet that is completely devoid of life was turned into a dump planet, where waste from the galaxies' riches was thrown. The Enchantress and Hope survived for 18 years by finding leftovers and other trash to thrive on. Know one knew how The Enchantress ended up in the Anti-Verse though. </p><p>After surviving they were thrown out of their home by the government drones looking for the thieves stealing from the dump. After finding The Enchantress’ Anti-self and Hum (Hunmie's Anti-self) they made a plan to go back to the real timeline. This plan was foiled when the government enforcers ‘The Sentinels’ had the team join them. After a few events in the HQ, the Anti-Verse’s May, Jay, who was close friends with Hum and Alice (Enchantress’ Anti-self), revealed himself as the demon within the Binding marble. Jay somehow collected all the marbles but Magic and Time. Jay pushed Hope and The Enchantress to the other timeline. Thus into The Calamity, where May killed all the deities but Kasie and Timey.</p><p>Hope fell in love with Zander in the Anti-Verse. Their bond grew bigger when they both learned of these powers that live inside them. Hope is what is called a Swordling, she was born half-human and half-sword (the sword being Xether, The Enchantress’ blade). Know one knows how… But the magic that is from the sword flows in her blood. Hope is said to be the one who moved Jaun back through time, with a similar spell that the original 7 used.</p>",
    "Zander" : "<h3><b>Zander (God of Space, From Anti-Verse)</b></h3> <p>Zander is from the Anti-Verse, everything in the Anti-Verse is connected to the universe. If you die, your Anti-self dies, ETC. Zander is the only child of Wink, Blink's antiverse self. Falion's anti-verse self didn't exist which was confusing. Zander at an early age was taken from Wink, when the memory change spell was cast. Zander grew up in an organization called Xurn headquarters, this organization was in charge of all the planets. Till he was promoted to Teamlead, and was very good at his job. When Hope and the Enchantress \"joined\" the organization, he was suspicious of Hope, she was poking around in areas she wasn't allowed. This led to him keeping an eye on her.</p> <p>Till the cluster ceremony happens, the ceremony selects 5 people and connects their subconscious. This allows them to access the memories, senses, and skills of the others in the cluster. This ceremony only happens once every 10 thousand years. During the ceremony, both Hope and Zander's subconscious merged. This led Zander to become closer to her and even had him looking for a way to help The Enchantress find a way home. Together they found Wink and the sword used to transport the Enchantress to the Anti-Verse. This led to Zander understanding his telekinesis powers. Giving Hope and Zander something to bond over, the fact that they both had great powers they needed to learn.</p> <p>During the final battle when the Any-Where marble was unfused from May, it sought out Zander for his powers came from the anti-verse version. But the marble accepted him nonetheless.</p>",
    "April" : "<h3><b>April (Goddest of Decay, Princess of the dead)</b></h3> <p>April was born to her mom, a mortal woman, and Galsmore (God of Decay). Both her mother and Galsmore raised April till she was 8, her mother wanted to raise her as a normal girl not connected to her demigod side. So Galsmore cast a spell to put all of her demigod powers into a teddy bear he gave her. Galsmore was with the family for 6 months then returned to the underworld for 6 months. Everything was good, till one day when her mom was driving on the highway, and was arguing with April about the radio. April wanted to get off the news channel, so she was turning the station dial, and her mother was turning it back. She was distracted turning the dial when she looked up she ran a red light and a semi-truck came hurtling into the car. The crash killed her mother, leaving April in the car alone perfectly untouched. April was taken to her grandparents' house. This is around the time Galsmore stopped coming up to Jaun, ridden with grief he stayed in the underworld where he was dealing with an uprising.</p> <p>April stayed with her parents till she was 18, she was at the top of her class in school. April tried to stay away from her strict grandparents' house as much as possible, she felt that they blamed her for their daughter's death. This weighed guilt on her for a long time, knowing she was the reason her mother died and her dad left.</p> <p>One day she was in her house and a meteor fell from the sky into her backyard. She ran to the door to discover a man in the crater, the man was Prince Alm. Alm's need to blend in had April help him become accustomed to the Mundane lifestyle. They became best friends, and when she started discovering her powers, Alm was there helping her. They found out she had some disease in her, killing her since she was separated from her demigod self. Alm helped her find out about the bear as she helped him find his ex. Then cue the Beast, and they won.</p> <p>After the Beast's defeat, she went on to college as Alm brought the modern era to Zaydia. Alm, with the help of April, went through all of Main to find the smartest people to create Zaydia as the advanced civilization it is today. While April went on to college, but she didn't forget her superhero days from defeating the beast. She would get in her costume and use her powers to save people. As she went through college she slowly stopped her vigilante lifestyle for a more stable life. While her friend, who was a ghost, wanted her to become a hero more. On one of her savings, she met another powered individual with the power to control the atmosphere and weather. She went on a few dates with her and learned her name was Fogg. When the next issue became more president, you see she knew how dying works. When you die a reaper is dispatched to take the soul to the afterlife. However the soul has to be willing, if the soul isn't willing it will be tethered to an object, usually a body. Her mother was one of the ones who were not willing. She couldn't move on till she knew April would be safe. April when she was figuring out her powers went to the graveyard with her grandma. She tried to see her mother's soul and talk. After talking for a while some other souls tried to take over her body when she discovered she could force the soul to do as she pleases. This was an uneasy feeling, controlling the spirits took away their free will. When she discovered she could control souls that were inside of people, she decided not to use the power until necessary. April with the help of her girlfriend decided to try and free the spirits from their bodies and let them go on the astral plane. This way they can finish their unfinished businesses and move on. April succeeded but ended up causing the next apocalypse. You see, spirits create magic in the atmosphere, so when she had them all leave the world magic started dying. She, with the help of her father, created a channel from the underworld to Jaun so magic could go free. This was the start of a couple of different world-ending situations till The Calamity.</p> <p>April began getting hunted down by demons under May's control. She and the others who stopped the beast, (those who remained) went to castle Salatude as a final stand. They held up for a couple of years till the final battle. During the battle when Kasie unbound her father's marble, it went into April. She was able to control May and Reality Shift and make them stand still as May took their marbles.</p>",
    "Fogg" : "<h3><b>Fogg (Goddest of Weather, Protecter)</b></h3> <p>Fogg lived a normal life, she had 3 moms who all loved her unconditionally. When she wanted to become a storm-chaser, her parents supported her. She would go after big storms record them and put them on YouTube. She wasn't famous but she made enough money to get by. Everything was great, till one day she heard of a giant storm on the coast of Main. This storm looked bigger than anyone she chased before on her machine. So she went for it when she made it close to the storm it was covered in a huge fog. Fogg knew that she could get tons of views if she got closer, so she drove through the fog. She found a good setup spot and left her car, she could see the havoc the storm was causing through the patches of fog. She got a good 5 minutes of footage before something strange happened. The storm and the fog became purple, Fogg had never seen anything like this happen before. Then the fog and storm came rushing at her, she hit the ground so hard that she blacked out. When she awoke she was miles away from her car, she was at the location of the eye of the storm. But there was no storm only her.</p> <p>A couple of weeks later, Fogg discovered that she could create and manipulate fog. She knew that she was given this gift for a reason, so she stopped storm chasing and decided to be a superhero. She protected hundreds of people and saved their lives multiple times. One day she decided to move to Gladia. She wanted a change of scenery. When fighting a supervillain, some other cute hero appeared. Together they stopped the villain, Fogg didn't know there was anyone else like her. She couldn't let this hero just leave, so she decided to ask her on a date. After a couple of dates with this mysterious hero, she learned her name was April (Demigod of Decay). She decided that she wanted more than casual meetings with April. She asked her out, and she said yes. Fogg didn't know it at the time, but this one question changed the course of her life forever.</p> <p>A few months into the relationship April told her about wanting to let the ghost go to the astral plane to finish the unfinished business. Fogg said she would help, she spent hours in the library in Salatude trying to find a spell to open a portal to the Astral plane and disconnect the souls to the dead bodies. With the help of Alex (Salatude's Consol Mage), she found a couple of spells that she was able to reverse engineer. She combined the principles of those spells and made a new spell that would do what she wanted. She brought this spell to April, with her connection to the afterlife, she would be the only one who could start the spell. April managed to convince her friends to help. The spell worked but came with unknown consequences. All of the magic was dying now, they didn't know that the spirits were creating the magic they relied on. Now that they are not on the same plane, the magic couldn't pierce through the Astral Plane. A few months into this situation, April made a deal with her father to connect Jaun to the magic power grid from the underworld. However, it wasn't going to be built in time before total planet extension. However, Alex (Demigod of Magic) found out that the portal they made was leaking out magic. So they decided if they could open more portals they could extend the amount of time they have to live. Fogg rewrote the original spell she made and gave it to April. She opened portals around the world, to let the magic through. After the bridge was made, April shut the portals to stop too much magic from spilling through.</p> <p>During The Calamity, Fogg decided to marry April, they didn't know how much more time they had to be together with being hunted every minute. During the final battle, while Kasie unbound the marbles, the weathered marble flung out of May. It sought out Fogg and fused. Making Fogg a goddess.</p>",
    "Alex" : "<h3><b>Alex (God of Magic, The Mage)</b></h3> <p>Alex is the son of the Castle Salatude Mage. Mages in Salatude are rare after the king went on a mage-killing spree. This leads to the mages going into hiding, all but his best friend, Alex's dad. Alex and his dad worked together with the king to do whatever magical needs he needed. Alex's dad, always being busy with the king didn't have time to raise Alex much or teach him magic. Which led to Alex playing with the king's son, who was around the same age. These boys were inseparable, they would cause mischief and sneak out constantly. It was no wonder Alm, the prince, fell in love with Alex. One day he decided to shoot his shot and ask out Alex, and Alex said yes. They dated for a good 3 years till one day when Alex was 19 he decided to surprise Alm with a picnic behind the castle walls. Everything was going well, till an arrow that was aimed at Alm was fired. Alex quickly jumped in front of the arrow, causing it to strike his heart. The assassin ran after seeing his failure to hit Alm. Alm panicked and ran to Alex's dad for help. When he arrived at the tower, he was nowhere to be seen. Alex saw one of the spell books that said it could heal Alex. He ran back to Alex and took some of his blood from his wound to summon a demon. The demon said she could heal Alex's heart in exchange for a favor from Alm and Alex. Alm panicked and was hesitant to do the deal, he had no idea what she wanted from him. The demon told him he had 60 seconds before Alex was no longer savable. Alex accepted the terms and made the demon deal. What Alex didn't know is that a demon deal is unbreakable. If you break it you will erupt in flames and die, if the demon breaks it the same will happen to them. The demon took some of Alex's blood and put it into Alm, to give him the ability to cast magic. Then she created a barrier around Alex's heart to stop the bleeding. Causing Alm to awaken to the whole situation. Alm realising that a demon deal was made on his behavior was filled with anger. He broke up with Alm, he didn't want to be with someone who decided stuff for him. His trust in Alm was tarnished, creating a rift between the boys that would last for as long as Alex lived.</p> <p>One day the king found out the location of the Mage Blood Hunters. The Blood Hunters sought out mages to kill them and use the mage's blood to cast magic. They had it out for those who were in connection to the one who took the hunter's magic from their blood. The king knew that they were traveling around Zaydia killing anyone in their path. The king decided to try and reason with them, however, he was captured. You see royal blood mixed with mage blood made spells more powerful, so they were happy to take him and bleed him out. Alex's dad noticed that the king was gone for a couple of days to negotiate with the Blood Hunters, so he with his sworn oath to do what it takes to protect the royal family, went after the king. After he left the demon knew this would be the best time to get the favor, since the two people who could stop her were gone. She had Alm gather powerful items from the royal treasury, and take them to the dungeon. When he did he met another mage, she said she also made a demon deal with her. She was going to free the demon from her world and allow her to permanently stay in this one. Alm however didn't think that was a good idea. So he switched out some of the herbs with different ones for the spell. Then he left so they could cast the spell, however with the ingredients being changed the spell malfunctioned and all that magic went into one of the demon's other spells, the barrier she put in Alex's heart. Then a week passed, and Alex and Alm were starting to get worried, about their dads missing. The consol still needing to run the kingdom decided that the King was probably dead and started to get Alm trained to take over his dad's duties. Alex couldn't just forget about his dad like he thought Alm did, so he took a backpack and some spell books and took off to Alm's room. After seeing how fired up Alex was told he would not go alone, he took his dad's sword. The boys made it to the camp and the camp leader greeted them. She could tell that they both contained mage blood, and Alm contained royal blood. So she played along with them, saying she might have seen their dads near the other side of the encampment. The boys followed her to the other side, as they walked past Blood Hunters the leader nodded towards them to be ready to kill them. As they reached the end of the encampment, the boys saw something hanging. They stood there frozen with horror, their dads were hanging there with their necks cut. So they decided to run, skimming one of his spell books while dodging spells. He found a spell called misty step, he knew that if he cast it he could appear behind the hunters and confuse them enough to escape. So he started casting, but the magic started going crazy. There was too much being put into the spell, and when he finished the mist consumed Alex, Alm, and the blood hunters. As they were thrown across the world into a town in Main. They were all separated and fell through the sky, Alex fell into the nearby lake. Some ongoers took him to a hospital.</p> <p>After escaping the hospital with a Blood Hunter, one that tried to kill him after their escape, Alex went looking for Alm. However, with Alex being in a super advanced modern-day place, he quickly got lost. When someone called the guardian showed up and offered to help Alex. The guardian seeing Alex's chaotic magic decided it would be better for Alex if the Guardian released it into the atmosphere. This spell would be completely harmless, however, he didn't know that the spell he cast would react badly to Alex's magic. It fired out in spirits of magic, this magic infused with the elements throughout the town. These magic-infused elements connected with the people around them, creating the infused like Fogg was. After the spell, the guardian brought the group together to destroy the Beast. This action led everyone in the group to make life-long connections.</p> <p>After defeating the Beast everyone had their stuff going on, Alm went back to Salatude to try and make it into the modern era, April went to college, and so on. But Alex didn't want to return to the castle, still not being ok with what Alm did. So he decided to go with the guardian and learn his operations. The guardian lived in a tower on an island near Lainen, the guardian is part of an organization called The Neitherland Guards. The Neitherland is neither here nor there it is a place in between all of the worlds. Blink (Deity of Space) took the strongest people worldwide and created the Neitherland Guards to help stop apocalyptic events. Almost all of the planets had a guardian, someone who lived on the planet and watched over it and made sure no one had enough power to end the world. Anyway, Alex wanted to try and learn more about all of it, so he stayed at the Tower. Alex started to fall for the Guardian, and they started dating. Alex found out that the Guardian was Kasie's son, making him the demigod of magic. He was also the son of a Niffin, someone who tried to cast a spell stronger than their body could support. To where their body burns away till they are just magic. They only have one thing on their mind, to finish their last thought. With nobody to hold them back, it usually can complete the thought. Once it is done the niffin will fade away and die, without a body they can't stay. So it is almost impossible for a half-niffin to be born unless their final thought was procreation. Anyways, so Alex and Alm get very close. Alex was doing field agent work as a superhero named 'The Mage', he would go stop worldwide problems. One day the Guardian asked Alex to marry him, and Alex said yes.</p> <p>Another world-ending thing later, Alex noticed The Guardian acting strangely. He found out the Guardian was possessed by an evil spirit. But by the time he and the rest of the group found out, the spirit was in full control. Alex tried looking for a way to separate the spirit from his husband but to no avail. And the spirit was going to take over the world, so Alex referred to a spell The Guardian taught him. This spell was special, it is the only spell that could kill a god. The Guardian made this spell to kill his best friend when she became a corrupt Goddess. However, you need the powers of a Demigod to perform the spell without niffining out. So he tricked the spirit into starting the spell, The Guardian used what strength he had left to finish the spell. But by doing this the remainder of his soul was gone. Alex would always blame himself for using the spell to kill his husband, who was possessed by Zane (The being of Chaos). But this spell destroyed Zane for good.</p> <p>Alex became the guardian over Jaun, for a couple of years. Till his grief for his husband took over, and he appointed Candace as the new Guardian. A couple of other stuff happened till the final battle. Alex used all the magic he could muster to damage Reality Shift. When Kasie came and unbinded the marbles, she niffined out. Leaving her marble, which fused into Alex.</p>",
    "Forrest" : "<h3><b>Forrest (God of Nature, The Forgotten)</h3></b> <p>Forrest was the last of Humanie & The Enchantress' kids. When he was one, The Enchantress vanished, leaving only Humanie to raise him. Humanie and The Enchantress had picked out a world for their next null child to be in charge of. Humanie was freaked out after the first month The Enchantress was gone, she had never been gone this long without a heads up. Humnie couldn't even contact her, all the ravens returned with the letters still on their feet. Humanie decided to go world by world to try and find her wife. This left Forrest to grow up on his own, he was forgotten about by both his mothers. Forrest had an ok childhood, going from each of his family's houses. His sister Valley decided to take him in under her care when he was 12. She took care of him as if he were her own, teaching him the ways of being a Demigod. When he turned 16 she brought him to the ascension ceremony, where he saw his mother for the first time in 10 years. She stopped visiting when he turned 6, so she could focus on finding her wife. When he didn't ascend, Humanie was indifferent. She told him of his birthright to rule Planet Forestcade, and then she left, calling him a useless null.</p> <p>When he turned 18 he decided to go to Forestcade with Valley to move in. Valley made sure he was going to be ok there before leaving. Forestcade is a planet that is one big forest. Forrest meets the locals, the Emni. The Emni are small creatures with the power to control the nature around them. The Emni quickly took Forrest in as he had similar powers to them (And he could reach high places easily). Forrest saw that the Emni didn't have a purpose in life, most of their farming failed and hunting parties came up short. Their towns were super small and would get attacked frequently. So Forrest cast a spell to disguise himself and take up the role of their god. At night he would put on his disguise and help the crops grow, hunt down animals, and help with infrastructure like walls. The Emni took on their new god figure and started worshiping him, making a huge statue of him.</p> <p>This went on for years, Forrest not wanting how the Emni saw him, kept up his disguise. Everything was good, till The Enchantress, Hunmie, and the group came looking for him. He was happy to meet his half-sister Hope and his other mom, however, tensions were still high between Hunmie and him. She kept insisting he was a null, but The Enchantress welcomed him with open arms. When Forrest learned he was one of the only Demigods alive, that his sister was dead he knew he had to join in the fight. After some hijinks with the Emi trying to make the statue alive to be their god permanently with Clair's magic, they got off Forrestcade.</p> <p>During the final battle, a powerful spell was hurled at Forrest, this spell would have killed Forrest, he thought he was done for. Till Hunmie jumped in front of the blast. Her final words were \"I'm sorry I couldn't be a better mother to you over the years, I hope in another time I could have not treated you and your other demigods as my children. I love you son.\" Forrest was crushed emotionally, his mother finally saw him as not a Null, but her son. Her marble shot out of her when Kasie was unfusing May's marbles. The Herb-marble merged with the animal-marble, then flung into Forrest.</p>"
