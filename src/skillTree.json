In Ghost Mode you gain the ability to levitate (While on the ground) you can float up to 10 feet off the ground, and can see up too 60 feet in the Ethereal Plane. Ghost mode can be used as much times as you have proficiency bonus. For these benefits you gain 15% Infusion Rate, once you hit 100% you will become permanently your chosen animal/beast forever. When in an interaction that may have your infused side wanting to do something, you must roll a d100 if you roll above your Infusion Rate you resist that action.",
