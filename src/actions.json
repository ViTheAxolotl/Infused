Binding a spirit requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted meditation. During this time, the witch speaks the invocations required to summon the spirit forth and enacts the rite of binding depending on which philosophy the witch subscribes to. A blood witch might utilize a bone fragment to bind the spirit, while a shadow witch might bargain with the summoned spirit, exchanging a secret for the spirit’s service. A witch may perform this ritual at any time to swap a bound spirit for a new one, losing the old passive benefit and gaining the new (or simply to change the spell slot level the same spirit is occupying). You choose a spirit to bind from the list at the end of this class description, and you fill one of your available spell slots with the spirit. The spell slot used is no longer available for casting spells, and it remains unavailable for as long as the spirit filling it remains bound to you. The spirit is said to be of a level equal to the spell slot used to bind it. Thus, a Spirit of Passion occupying a 6th level spell slot is a level 6 spirit. You cannot have more than one spirit with the same name bound at once. Depending on the type of spirit, you gain certain benefits while the spirit remains bound and an additional effect when you release the spirit, as detailed in the Binding Rites section. Releasing a spirit is a bonus action, although some spirits allow release as a reaction. Once a spirit has been released, it no longer provides its passive effect and the spell slot it occupied is expended. You can bind a number of spirits up to the number shown for your witch level in the Bonds column of the witch table"},"Spirit Ward":{"name":"Spirit Ward","description":"At 3rd level, you learn a rite that offers protection against spirits who wish you or your allies harm.

You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. \nIf you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.
